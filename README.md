This was just an attempt at something I've never tried before.

###################\n
Please make sure to first install the requirements.
The script doesn't require much actions from the user aside of logging into the Gmail account to upload the file.

1. pip3 install -r requirements.txt
2. It should install PyDrive with the additional libraries, all of the other pre-exists within Python 3.7 and above.
3. Run main.py.
4. That's it.

The rest of the task I ran out of time trying to figure out the exact requests, therefore I believe this is a DNF.
Thanks for the opportunity.

P.S.
This is a newly registered email.\n
